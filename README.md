# Accountability
I've just implemented the accountability pattern for organisation unit.
This pattern was introduced by Martin Fowler for organisation structure.
You can find it through below link:

Needless to say. this implementation is just a first try, and during upcomming months, it will be upgraded ASAP by adding some Neo4j DB.
